# Mathlabs

This is a software that helps to solve complex mathematical problems in seconds it makes us of various mathematical algorithms and formulas to arrive at answers to different questions from a variety of topics.

## Getting started 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. see deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisite

- **Git**
- **node.js**
- **Angular.js**
- **mongodb** 

## Installing 
to clone this repository, use `git clone https://github.com/Geniuska275/G-mathlab.git`
set up your local version to track the remote using `git remote add origin https://github.com/Geniuska275/G-mathlab.git`
to contribute, create a new branch from the main branch using the command `git branch branch_name` then checkout into the newly created branch using `git checkout branch_name`

All changes should be commited to your personal branc the pushed to the remote version using `git push -u origin branch_name`
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
